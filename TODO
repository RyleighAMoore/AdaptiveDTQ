- Make plot titles dynamic
- Make Integrand animation better for the Y axis
- Write some unit tests

2/4/19
- Look into possible spectral orth. poly method if bored someday to (most likely) eliminate it as
 a good idea. I.e. this will most likely not work.

5/1/19
- Fix the Boolean in simpleDTQ to not break the code.
- Check for ways to avoid removing and adding the same value back to the grid. Possibly use the epsilon value to do this?
- Figure out Orth Poly interpolation on [a,b].
- Figure out why the 2D method is drifting to one direction.

6/22/19
- Accomodate g1=0 case. 
- Accodomdate cases with no diffusion in one direction but drift is still in both directions.
