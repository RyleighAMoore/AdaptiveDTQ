- change the quadrature rule when the grid evolves

1/14/19
DONE

1/28/19
- Make plot titles dynamic
- Make Integrand animation better for the Y axis
- Write some unit tests

2/4/19
- Update quadrature rule to use a non equidistant trapezoidal rule
- Look for way to determine how to update a grid (coarser in some areas and finer in others)
using a derivative (gradient)
- Numerically enforce eigenvalue to have density 1 and add to animation as the solution.
- Look into possible spectral orth. poly method if bored someday to (most likely) eliminate it as
 a good idea. I.e. this will most likely not work.
