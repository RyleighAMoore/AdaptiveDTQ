- Generate example when simulation on current grid is poor (compare to
  overresovled example)
- prescribe method to redefine grid. I.e., evolve the grid with time
- change the quadrature rule when the grid evolves

- Plot the integrand over time
- Plot $\epsilon = max[log(G(y_l,y_{-M})\hat{p}(y_{-M},t_n))] +
  max[log(G(y_l,y_{M})\hat{p}(y_{M},t_n))]$ for each time step.
- Prescribe method to redefine grid if the epsilon becomes too large.
  This will boil down to adding rows to the kernel matrix G.
  if eps > num: (ie integrand is < e^{-num})
        ...
  else:
    Go back a time step
    Add rows to M
    test epsilon again

- Add and remove values from G
- Plot first eigenvector of G
- Try with f(x)=1 and small diffusion.
